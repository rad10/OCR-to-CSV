# How to Use OCR to CSV
This is an easy process. This can be done in roughly 3 steps.

 * Step 1: Use a scanner to scan your pdf. The higher the quality, the better results you get. A PDF is the best file type to use.
 * Step 2: run the software using the PDF scanned in
 * Step 3: double check the excel sheet given by the software to make sure it has given accurate results
 * Step 4: Profit. Repeat the process with all of your sheets and you are done.

As a warning. The software tries to get the most accurate information possible. However, if the sheet is handwritten (as what may be expected with a sign in sheet) it is prone to fail. So, double checking the values given is very important.

In addition, it may be worth it to run your first initial sheet twice, so that it can register all the new names and purposes involved.
